# MAKE YOUR GAME

The Brick Breaker game.


Game runs at at least 60 FPS at all times
No frame drops!
Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!

Pause menu, that includes:

- Continue;
- Restart;

A score board that displays the following metrics:

- Username;
- Score that will display the current score (XP or points);

The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.

You must not use frameworks or canvas, the game must be implemented using plain JS/DOM and HTML only

## Usage

1. You can start the program by running the following command:
```
go run .
```
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. To end the server:
```
CTRL + C
```
